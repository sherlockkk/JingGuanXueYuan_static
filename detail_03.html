                <div>
                    <span style="font-size: 12px;">(1) Professional Profile: This major began to recruit undergraduates facing the country since 1986, and is the first undergraduate major of the national engineering management (engineering cost management), which has cultivated to train nearly 3,000 undergraduates for the society. Pass rate of registered cost engineers always comes the first and enjoys a very high reputation in the field of engineering cost. In 1996, this major was identified as key construction discipline of Jiangxi Province and in 2002 was approved as a brand specialty in Jiangxi Province. In 1995, the major began to recruit postgraduates, and formed a multi-level pattern of unified enrollment of master students, engineering master students, masters of equivalent and undergraduates, which highlights the characteristics that based on engineering technology and featured engineering cost control in the whole life cycle. Numerous students recognized this major as a hot specialty which recruits students the most easily and have the best job opportunities.
(2) Professional Training Goals: This major cultivates application-oriented and investigative personnel who possess fundamental knowledge of management, economy, civil engineering technology, master theories, methods and means in modern management science, and have strong practical application ability, social adaption ability and certain innovation ability, as well as can work on cost calculation and audit, engineering decision-making, project management of engineering cost in the field of engineering construction management.</span>
