            <div style="text-align: justify;">
                <span style="font-size: 12px;">Teng Anqing et al, on the basis of previous studies, are building a new set of regional economic space and network theory-- that is the economic T space and its N network theory, with the philosophy as basics, mathematics (set theory, topology, fractal geometry) as the means, space, time and energy as the content, and economic network and the economy as the point of view. They have used mathematical means to abstract and solidify the relevant academic ideas about new theoretical framework, and initially formed their own theoretical framework. The direction has held 5 provincial and ministerial projects, and published over 20 articles, such as Development Zone Industrial Cluster Research Based on Economic ETPN Economic Network Theory（Jiangxi colleges and universities humanities）held by Teng Qingan, Red Triangle Economic Circle Economic Network Based on Economic Point Network Theory（Jiangxi colleges and universities humanities）held by Zhu Wenxing.
The method and application of regional economic analysis is an important research direction in our regional economics. By use of the mathematical methods such as cellular automaton, set theory, topology, fractal geometry, etc., our teaching staff have combined the structural analysis of the point, line and surface of the network, and established a set of theoretical research outlines. They also use the system dynamics, input and output, cellular automaton, system simulation, fractal geometry and other analysis and evaluation methods to do long-term study on regional or industrial economy field, forming an obvious characteristic. Teng Qingan et al have studied the fractal evolution rule of economic network by use of fractal geometry; Huang Xiaodong et al have studied the circular economy of nonferrous metal industry by use of system dynamics method, and made some innovations in theory and research method, and achieved good results; Zhu Wenxing has analyzed the regional economic network system integration by use of the system; Huangxue Liang et al and have studied the coordinated development of the local economic sectors and the input and output efficiency , the research methods in which are innovative.
On combining local industry characteristics, they have studied the local industrial clusters; Professor Teng Qingan has studied the industry cluster evolution based on cellular automata; Professor Huang Shunchun has studied the local industry cluster changes; Huang Xiaodong has studied the sustainable development in Dongjiang based on region system dynamics; Huang Xuoliang has studied the regional industry evaluation and sustainable development; Peng Feng and Zheng Minggui et al have studied the non-ferrous metal mine scale efficiency based on the scale economies analysis method.
In this direction, there’s a young and strong academic team, including two professors and three Dr.s, who have rich experience in teaching and research. Innovation and application research has always been our mission. We are now involved in over 10 provincial and ministerial projects and over 10 local government projects. Over 70 articles have been published on Economic Geography, Industrial Technology & Economy and other well-known publications. With the globalization of economy, regional harmonious development issues have become increasingly prominent. This direction will have a stronger academic vitality and a brighter future.</span>
